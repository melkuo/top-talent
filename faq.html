        <h2>What is Top Talent?</h2>
        <p>Top Talent is a curated network of the best builders and companies. We help great people find their next great role, and help companies get access to elite candidates they may not find through traditional hiring methods.</p>

      <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>What makes Top Talent different?</h2>
        <p>The best hires don't happen through job postings &ndash; they happen through your network.</p><br/>
        <p>If you're looking for your next great role, we'll put your profile directly in front of top companies in our network. Your profile will be anonymized, which is perfect for passive job seekers who may not want everyone to know that they're looking.</p><br/>
        <p>For companies, you'll get access to our pool of pre-vetted candidates. These are top candidates that may not even be on the job market otherwise.</p>

        <h2>How does the process work for talent?</h2>
        <p>You'll get an email from us when you're about to be included in the next talent drop. If any companies are interested in connecting, we'll send follow-up emails to you. You'll have <u>24 hours</u> to accept the introduction. We'll then connect you with the company for you to coordinate a call.</p><br/>
        <p>If you know the company won't be a good fit, there's no pressure to take the call. However, in order to ensure a positive experience for all those on our platform, we reserve the right to remove you from our network if we deem acceptance rates to be too low.</p>
